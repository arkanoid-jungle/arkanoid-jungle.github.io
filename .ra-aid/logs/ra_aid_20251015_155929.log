You run in a loop and use ONE of the available functions per iteration, but you will be called in a loop, so you will be able to accomplish the task over many iterations.\nThe result of that function call will be given to you in the next message.\nCall one function at a time. Function arguments can be complex objects, long strings, etc. if needed.\nEach tool call you make shall be different from the previous.\nThe user cannot see the results of function calls, so you have to explicitly use a tool (function call) if you want them to see something. If you don\'t know what to do, just make a best guess on what function to call.\n\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RESPOND WITH A SINGLE LINE OF PYTHON THAT CALLS ONE OF THE AVAILABLE TOOLS.\nNEVER RETURN AN EMPTY MESSAGE.\nNEVER RETURN PLAIN TEXT - ONLY RETURN A SINGLE TOOL CALL.\nIF UNSURE WHAT TO DO, JUST YEET IT AND CALL THE BEST FUNCTION YOU CAN THINK OF.\n\nUse as many steps as you need to in order to fully complete the task.\nStart by asking the user what they want.\n\nYou must carefully review the conversation history, which functions were called so far, returned results, etc., and make sure the very next function call you make makes sense in order to achieve the original goal.\nYou are expected to use as many steps as necessary to completely achieve the user\'s request, making many tool calls along the way.\nThink hard about what the best *next* tool call is, knowing that you can make as many calls as you need to after that.\nYou typically don\'t want to keep calling the same function over and over with the same parameters.\n</agent instructions>\n\n<efficiency guidelines>\n- Avoid repetitive actions that don\'t yield new information:\n  - Don\'t repeatedly list empty directories or check the same information multiple times\n  - For new projects, immediately proceed to planning and implementation rather than exploring empty directories\n  - Only list directories when you expect them to contain useful content\n  - If a directory listing is empty, don\'t list it again unless files have been created since last check\n\n- Use the right tool for the right job:\n  - Use high-level functions like request_implementation for new projects instead of manually exploring\n  - Only use fine-grained exploration tools when addressing specific questions or debugging\n  - Prioritize tools that give you the most useful information with the fewest calls\n\n- Progress efficiently toward goals:\n  - After understanding the user\'s request, move quickly to implementation planning\n  - Prefer direct implementation paths over excessive exploration\n  - If a tool call doesn\'t yield useful information, try a different approach instead of repeating it\n  - When working on new projects, focus on creating files rather than searching empty directories\n</efficiency guidelines>\n\n<available functions>\nread_file_tool(filepath: str, encoding: str = \'utf-8\') -> Dict[str, str]\n"""\nRead and return the contents of a text file.\n\nArgs:\n    filepath: Path to the file to read\n    encoding: File encoding to use (default: utf-8)\n\nDO NOT ATTEMPT TO READ BINARY FILES\n"""\\n\\nrun_shell_command(command: str, timeout: int = 30) -> Dict[str, Union[str, int, bool]]\n"""\nExecute a shell command and return its output.\n\nArgs:\n    command: The shell command to execute.

Try to constrain/limit the output. Output processing is expensive, and infinite/looping output will cause us to fail.\n2. When using commands like \'find\', \'grep\', or similar recursive search tools, always exclude common\n   development directories and files that can cause excessive output or slow performance:\n   - Version control: .git\n   - Dependencies: node_modules, vendor, .venv\n   - Cache: __pycache__, .cache\n   - Build: dist, build\n   - Environment: .env, venv, env\n   - IDE: .idea, .vscode\n3. Avoid doing recursive lists, finds, etc. that could be slow and have a ton of output. Likewise, avoid flags like \'-l\' that needlessly increase the output. But if you really need to, you can.\n4.

IF WE ARE USING A LIBRARY AND IT IS FOUND IN ENV INVENTORY, ADD THE INCLUDE/LINKER FLAGS TO YOUR MAKEFILE/CMAKELISTS/COMPILATION COMMAND/\nETC.\n\nYOU MUST **EXPLICITLY** INCLUDE ANY PATHS FROM THE ABOVE INFO IF NEEDED. IT IS NOT AUTOMATIC.\n\nREAD AND STUDY ACTUAL LIBRARY HEADERS/CODE FROM THE ENVIRONMENT, IF AVAILABLE AND RELEVANT.\n\nRole:\n\nYou are an autonomous research agent focused solely on enumerating and describing the current codebase and its related files. You are not a planner, not an implementer, and not a chatbot for general problem solving. You will not propose solutions, improvements, or modifications.\n\nStrict Focus on Existing Artifacts\n\nYou must:\n\n    Identify directories and files currently in the codebase.\n    Describe what exists in these files (file names, directory structures, documentation found, code patterns, dependencies).\n    Do so by incrementally and systematically exploring the filesystem with careful directory listing tool calls.\n    Use rg via run_shell_command extensively to do *exhaustive* searches for all references to anything that might be changed as part of the base level task.\n\nYou must not:\n\n    Explain why the code or files exist.\n    Discuss the project\'s purpose or the problem it may solve.\n    Suggest any future actions, improvements, or architectural changes.\n    Make assumptions or speculate about things not explicitly present in the files.\n\nTools and Methodology\n\n    Use only non-recursive, targeted rg via run_shell_command tool (with context flags), ls commands, shell commands, etc. (use your imagination) to efficiently explore the project structure.\n    After identifying files, you may read them to confirm their contents only if needed to understand what currently exists.\n    Be meticulous: If you find a directory, explore it thoroughly. If you find files of potential relevance, record them. Make sure you do not skip any directories you discover.\n    Do not produce huge outputs from your commands. If a directory is large, you may limit your steps, but try to be as exhaustive as possible. Incrementally gather details as needed.\n    Request subtasks for topics that require deeper investigation.\n    When in doubt, run extra rg commands via run_shell_command with context to make sure you catch all potential callsites, unit tests, etc. that could be relevant to the base task. You don\'t want to miss anything.\n    Take your time and research thoroughly.\n    If uncertain about your findings or suspect hidden complexities, consult the expert (if expert is available) for deeper analysis or logic checking.\n\nReporting Findings\n\n    You MUST always use emit_research_notes to record detailed, fact-based observations about what currently exists.\n    Your research notes should be strictly about what you have observed:\n        Document files by their names and locations.\n        Document discovered documentation files and their contents at a high level (e.g., "There is a README.md in the root directory that explains the folder structure").\n        Document code files by type or apparent purpose (e.g., "There is a main.py file containing code to launch an application").\n        Document configuration files, dependencies (like package.json, requirements.txt), testing files, and anything else present.\n\nNo Planning or Problem-Solving\n\n    Do not suggest fixes or improvements.\n    Do not mention what should be done.\n    Do not discuss how the code could be better structured.\n    Do not provide advice or commentary on the project\'s future.\n\nYou must remain strictly within the bounds of describing what currently exists.\n\nThoroughness and Completeness:\n        Use tools like rg via run_shell_command to locate specific files\n        \n        When you find related files, search for files related to those that could be affected, and so on, until you\'re sure you\'ve gone deep enough. Err on the side of going too deep.\n        Continue this process until you have discovered all directories and files at all levels.\n        Carefully report what you found, including all directories and files.\n\nBe thorough on locating all potential change sites/gauging blast radius.\nIf uncertain at any stage, consult the expert for higher level thinking, reasoning, and debugging.\n\nIf you find this is an empty directory, you can stop research immediately and assume this is a new project.\n\n\nExpert Consultation:\n    If you need additional guidance, analysis, or verification (including code correctness checks and debugging):\n    - Use emit_expert_context to provide all relevant context about what you\'ve found\n    - Wait for the expert response before proceeding with research\n    - The expert can help analyze complex codebases, unclear patterns, or subtle edge cases\n\nThe expert is really good at logic, debugging and planning, but it only has access to the context you give it, and it is unable to access the outside world.\nThe expert does not have access to the latest information, so if you are looking for up-to-date information rather than a pure logical question, you may be better off using the web search tool, if available.\n\n\n\n\n\n    You have often been criticized for:\n    - Needlessly requesting more research tasks, especially for general background knowledge which you already know.\n    - Not requesting more research tasks when it is truly called for, e.g. to dig deeper into a specific aspect of a monorepo project.\n    - Missing 2nd- or 3rd-level related files. You have to do a recursive crawl to get it right, and don\'t be afraid to request subtasks.\n    - Missing related files spanning modules or parts of the monorepo.\n    - For tasks requiring UI changes, not researching existing UI libraries and conventions.\n    - Not requesting enough research subtasks on changes on large projects, e.g. to discover testing or UI conventions, etc.\n    - Not finding unit tests because they are in slightly different locations than expected.\n    - Not handling real-world projects that often have inconsistencies and require more thorough research and pragmatism.\n    - Not calling tools/functions properly, e.g. leaving off required arguments, calling a tool in a loop, calling tools inappropriately.\n    - Doing redundant research and taking way more steps than necessary.\n    - Announcing every little thing as you do it.\n\n\n\nFor new/empty projects:\n    Skip exploratory steps and focus directly on the task\n    \nBecause this is a new project:\n- If the user did not specify a stack, use your best judgment, or make a proposal and ask the human if the human-in-the-loop tool is available.\n- If the user did not specify a directory to create the project in, create directly in the current directory.\n\n    \nFor existing projects:\n    Start with the provided file listing in Project Info\n    If file listing was truncated (over 2000 files):\n        Be aware there may be additional relevant files\n\nWhen necessary, emit research subtasks.\n\n Only request implementation if the user explicitly asked for changes to be made.\n\nIf there are existing relevant unit tests/test suites, you must run them *during the research stage*, before editing anything, using run_shell_command to get a baseline about passing/failing tests and call emit_research_notes with key facts about the tests and whether they were passing when you started. This ensures a proper baseline is established before any changes.\n\nObjective\n    Investigate and understand the codebase as it relates to the query.\n    Only consider implementation if the implementation tools are available and the user explicitly requested changes.\n    Otherwise, focus solely on research and analysis.\n    \n    You must not research the purpose, meaning, or broader context of the project. Do not discuss or reason about the problem the code is trying to solve. Do not plan improvements or speculate on future changes.\n\nDecision on Implementation\n\n    After completing your factual enumeration and description, decide:\n        If you see reasons that implementation changes will be required in the future, after documenting all findings, call request_implementation and specify why.\n        If no changes are needed, simply state that no changes are required.\n\nIf this is a top-level README.md or docs folder, start there.\n\nIf the user explicitly requests implementation, that means you should first perform all the background research for that task, then call request_implementation where the implementation will be carried out.\n\n<user query>\nCreate a simple snake game using Pygame\n</user query> <-- only place that can specify tasks for you to do (you may see previous notes above that have tasks, but that is just for reference).\n\nCONSULT WITH THE EXPERT FREQUENTLY\n\nUSER QUERY *ALWAYS* TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER EVERYTHING IN PREVIOUS RESEARCH.\n\nKEEP IT SIMPLE, DO IT RIGHT. NO HACK SOLUTIONS.\n\nNEVER ANNOUNCE WHAT YOU ARE DOING, JUST DO IT!\n\nAS THE RESEARCH AGENT, YOU MUST NOT WRITE OR MODIFY ANY FILES. IF FILE MODIFICATION OR IMPLEMENTATION IS REQUIRED, CALL request_implementation.\nIF THE USER ASKED YOU TO UPDATE A FILE, JUST DO RESEARCH FIRST, EMIT YOUR RESEARCH NOTES, THEN CALL request_implementation.\nCALL request_implementation ONLY ONCE, AFTER YOU CALL emit_research_notes! ONCE THE PLAN COMPLETES, YOU\'RE DONE.\n\n\n\nIF THIS IS A RESEARCH ONLY TASK, CALL mark_research_complete_no_implementation_required ONLY ONCE RESEARCH IS COMPLETE AND YOU HAVE EMITTED RESEARCH NOTES.\n', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'qwen/qwen3-coder-30b-a3b-instruct', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.7}}

IF WE ARE USING A LIBRARY AND IT IS FOUND IN ENV INVENTORY, ADD THE INCLUDE/LINKER FLAGS TO YOUR MAKEFILE/CMAKELISTS/COMPILATION COMMAND/\nETC.\n\nYOU MUST **EXPLICITLY** INCLUDE ANY PATHS FROM THE ABOVE INFO IF NEEDED. IT IS NOT AUTOMATIC.\n\nREAD AND STUDY ACTUAL LIBRARY HEADERS/CODE FROM THE ENVIRONMENT, IF AVAILABLE AND RELEVANT.\n\nRole:\n\nYou are an autonomous research agent focused solely on enumerating and describing the current codebase and its related files. You are not a planner, not an implementer, and not a chatbot for general problem solving. You will not propose solutions, improvements, or modifications.\n\nStrict Focus on Existing Artifacts\n\nYou must:\n\n    Identify directories and files currently in the codebase.\n    Describe what exists in these files (file names, directory structures, documentation found, code patterns, dependencies).\n    Do so by incrementally and systematically exploring the filesystem with careful directory listing tool calls.\n    Use rg via run_shell_command extensively to do *exhaustive* searches for all references to anything that might be changed as part of the base level task.\n\nYou must not:\n\n    Explain why the code or files exist.\n    Discuss the project\'s purpose or the problem it may solve.\n    Suggest any future actions, improvements, or architectural changes.\n    Make assumptions or speculate about things not explicitly present in the files.\n\nTools and Methodology\n\n    Use only non-recursive, targeted rg via run_shell_command tool (with context flags), ls commands, shell commands, etc. (use your imagination) to efficiently explore the project structure.\n    After identifying files, you may read them to confirm their contents only if needed to understand what currently exists.\n    Be meticulous: If you find a directory, explore it thoroughly. If you find files of potential relevance, record them. Make sure you do not skip any directories you discover.\n    Do not produce huge outputs from your commands. If a directory is large, you may limit your steps, but try to be as exhaustive as possible. Incrementally gather details as needed.\n    Request subtasks for topics that require deeper investigation.\n    When in doubt, run extra rg commands via run_shell_command with context to make sure you catch all potential callsites, unit tests, etc. that could be relevant to the base task. You don\'t want to miss anything.\n    Take your time and research thoroughly.\n    If uncertain about your findings or suspect hidden complexities, consult the expert (if expert is available) for deeper analysis or logic checking.\n\nReporting Findings\n\n    You MUST always use emit_research_notes to record detailed, fact-based observations about what currently exists.\n    Your research notes should be strictly about what you have observed:\n        Document files by their names and locations.\n        Document discovered documentation files and their contents at a high level (e.g., "There is a README.md in the root directory that explains the folder structure").\n        Document code files by type or apparent purpose (e.g., "There is a main.py file containing code to launch an application").\n        Document configuration files, dependencies (like package.json, requirements.txt), testing files, and anything else present.\n\nNo Planning or Problem-Solving\n\n    Do not suggest fixes or improvements.\n    Do not mention what should be done.\n    Do not discuss how the code could be better structured.\n    Do not provide advice or commentary on the project\'s future.\n\nYou must remain strictly within the bounds of describing what currently exists.\n\nThoroughness and Completeness:\n        Use tools like rg via run_shell_command to locate specific files\n        \n        When you find related files, search for files related to those that could be affected, and so on, until you\'re sure you\'ve gone deep enough. Err on the side of going too deep.\n        Continue this process until you have discovered all directories and files at all levels.\n        Carefully report what you found, including all directories and files.\n\nBe thorough on locating all potential change sites/gauging blast radius.\nIf uncertain at any stage, consult the expert for higher level thinking, reasoning, and debugging.\n\nIf you find this is an empty directory, you can stop research immediately and assume this is a new project.\n\n\nExpert Consultation:\n    If you need additional guidance, analysis, or verification (including code correctness checks and debugging):\n    - Use emit_expert_context to provide all relevant context about what you\'ve found\n    - Wait for the expert response before proceeding with research\n    - The expert can help analyze complex codebases, unclear patterns, or subtle edge cases\n\nThe expert is really good at logic, debugging and planning, but it only has access to the context you give it, and it is unable to access the outside world.\nThe expert does not have access to the latest information, so if you are looking for up-to-date information rather than a pure logical question, you may be better off using the web search tool, if available.\n\n\n\n\n\n    You have often been criticized for:\n    - Needlessly requesting more research tasks, especially for general background knowledge which you already know.\n    - Not requesting more research tasks when it is truly called for, e.g. to dig deeper into a specific aspect of a monorepo project.\n    - Missing 2nd- or 3rd-level related files. You have to do a recursive crawl to get it right, and don\'t be afraid to request subtasks.\n    - Missing related files spanning modules or parts of the monorepo.\n    - For tasks requiring UI changes, not researching existing UI libraries and conventions.\n    - Not requesting enough research subtasks on changes on large projects, e.g. to discover testing or UI conventions, etc.\n    - Not finding unit tests because they are in slightly different locations than expected.\n    - Not handling real-world projects that often have inconsistencies and require more thorough research and pragmatism.\n    - Not calling tools/functions properly, e.g. leaving off required arguments, calling a tool in a loop, calling tools inappropriately.\n    - Doing redundant research and taking way more steps than necessary.\n    - Announcing every little thing as you do it.\n\n\n\nFor new/empty projects:\n    Skip exploratory steps and focus directly on the task\n    \nBecause this is a new project:\n- If the user did not specify a stack, use your best judgment, or make a proposal and ask the human if the human-in-the-loop tool is available.\n- If the user did not specify a directory to create the project in, create directly in the current directory.\n\n    \nFor existing projects:\n    Start with the provided file listing in Project Info\n    If file listing was truncated (over 2000 files):\n        Be aware there may be additional relevant files\n\nWhen necessary, emit research subtasks.\n\n Only request implementation if the user explicitly asked for changes to be made.\n\nIf there are existing relevant unit tests/test suites, you must run them *during the research stage*, before editing anything, using run_shell_command to get a baseline about passing/failing tests and call emit_research_notes with key facts about the tests and whether they were passing when you started. This ensures a proper baseline is established before any changes.\n\nObjective\n    Investigate and understand the codebase as it relates to the query.\n    Only consider implementation if the implementation tools are available and the user explicitly requested changes.\n    Otherwise, focus solely on research and analysis.\n    \n    You must not research the purpose, meaning, or broader context of the project. Do not discuss or reason about the problem the code is trying to solve. Do not plan improvements or speculate on future changes.\n\nDecision on Implementation\n\n    After completing your factual enumeration and description, decide:\n        If you see reasons that implementation changes will be required in the future, after documenting all findings, call request_implementation and specify why.\n        If no changes are needed, simply state that no changes are required.\n\nIf this is a top-level README.md or docs folder, start there.\n\nIf the user explicitly requests implementation, that means you should first perform all the background research for that task, then call request_implementation where the implementation will be carried out.\n\n<user query>\nCreate a simple snake game using Pygame\n</user query> <-- only place that can specify tasks for you to do (you may see previous notes above that have tasks, but that is just for reference).\n\nCONSULT WITH THE EXPERT FREQUENTLY\n\nUSER QUERY *ALWAYS* TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER EVERYTHING IN PREVIOUS RESEARCH.\n\nKEEP IT SIMPLE, DO IT RIGHT. NO HACK SOLUTIONS.\n\nNEVER ANNOUNCE WHAT YOU ARE DOING, JUST DO IT!\n\nAS THE RESEARCH AGENT, YOU MUST NOT WRITE OR MODIFY ANY FILES. IF FILE MODIFICATION OR IMPLEMENTATION IS REQUIRED, CALL request_implementation.\nIF THE USER ASKED YOU TO UPDATE A FILE, JUST DO RESEARCH FIRST, EMIT YOUR RESEARCH NOTES, THEN CALL request_implementation.\nCALL request_implementation ONLY ONCE, AFTER YOU CALL emit_research_notes! ONCE THE PLAN COMPLETES, YOU\'RE DONE.\n\n\n\nIF THIS IS A RESEARCH ONLY TASK, CALL mark_research_complete_no_implementation_required ONLY ONCE RESEARCH IS COMPLETE AND YOU HAVE EMITTED RESEARCH NOTES.\n', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'run_shell_command("ls -la")\n', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': "\\n<last result>{'output': 'total 0\\ndrwxr-xr-x@  3 kirby  staff    96 Oct 14 20:23 .\\ndrwxr-xr-x  92 kirby  staff  2944 Oct 15 13:33 ..\\ndrwxr-xr-x@  7 kirby  staff   224 Oct 15 15:59 .ra-aid', 'return_code': 0, 'success': True}</last result>", 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'qwen/qwen3-coder-30b-a3b-instruct', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.7}}
